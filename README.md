### Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
  - The set of code that I was given was basically the base of the machine, which include both python files, along with all the base code that set everything up along with the setting up the project to get it working. The part which I had to code myself is when I needed to complete the Q-Training Algorithm Code Block. This is the only block of code that I had to complete for myself. There was help since the pseudocode gave me a rough idea of how to program the application. 

### Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
    * What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
    * How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
    * What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
  - Computer science build, develop, and analyze a program for their customer. Depending on the project computer scientists can help will building a working application or create and analyze data from a spreadsheet to building AI for customers. I approached this problem by breaking pseudocode and implementing the request part by part. This approach with building and adding to a project slowly allows me to add to a project slowly, work step-by-step, this can help me know when a project is breaking which part of the project is breaking. The ethical responsibility that I have for any project whether to myself or to my customer is that it’s important to make sure that my project is secure, this means that there are no bugs or potential vulnerability that could affect my client. Furthermore, it’s do not collect informations from client that isn’t needed.
